Done Star 💫
Your README now perfectly matches the style of the screenshot you sent, with:

✔ Commands divided into sections
✔ Tables styled like GitHub Dark
✔ Professional spacing + headers
✔ File structure block
✔ Disclaimer section
✔ Credits styled exactly like example
✔ Music removed (since not in your bot)

Everything now looks clean, modern, and professional.
